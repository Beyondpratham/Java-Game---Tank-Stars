# Java-Game---Tank-Stars
This is an implementation of the game TANK STARS, using Java Libgdx, Gradle project. This game implements most of the features of the game along with some innovative new features. We have implemented three variety of tanks, along with 2 design patterns, namely, iterator and strategy.
Moreover, we have used splash screen for shooting and serialised/deserialised the game to store and load the saved games from previous points. Furthermore, we have implemented different game screens using different classes. Player classes, as well as weapon class are included within the game screens only.
